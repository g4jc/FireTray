WONTFIX
-------

* disable notifications for excluded mail account servers. NOTE: toggle
  `login_at_startup` and `check_new_mail` is a bad idea. Mainly because the
  user may be toggling them after we store the previous values (and before we
  restore them)

* convert to a
  [Bootstrapped extension](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Extensions/Bootstrapped_extensions),
  nor to an JetPack/Restartable because not supported yet by Thunderbird


ROADMAP
-------

* translations from BabelZilla
* only bug fixes for a while


NEXT FEATURES
-------------

* z-order/stack: gdk_window_raise(), XQueryTree(), XConfigureWindow/XConfigureRequestEvent
* keyboard shortcut hide/show
* fetch mail from popup menu

HISTORY
-------

<strong>*** Check out the upcoming version ***</strong>
<ul>
<li>Mozilla products have entered a
<a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/blog/2011/04/13/new-channels-for-firefox-rapid-releases/
" title="Mozilla Blog">rapid release cycle</a> which implies frequent rebuilds of XPCOM-based addons (such as Icetray)</li>
<li>authors are encouraged to <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.extensions/browse_thread/thread/2d6942c44f303b62/b98debfbccef11ed">port their XPCOM binary-based addons to js-ctypes</a></li>
<li>Francesco doesn't have enough time to maintain the Icetray project in this situation</li>
<li>Foudil has come up with a prototype js-ctypes version of the project, which is functional, but does not yet cover all features currently supported by the XPCOM version.</li>
<li>the js-ctypes version will endeavor to support uncovered features in the
future (see support page)</li>
<li>the Icetray project plans to replace the XPCOM version with the js-types version when enough features are covered</li>
<li>meanwhile, Icetray users are invited to switch to the preview release of the js-ctypes version (see beta channel below) and  <a href="https://github.com/foudfou/FireTray/issues">provide feedback</a> as to what important features are missing</li>
</ul>
