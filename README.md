Notes
-----

* Under Linux:
  * GTK+ 2.20+ required.
  * libappindicator3 can be used for StatusNotifierItem (KDE, Unity).
* Under Windows, few features are not yet implemented.
* Icetray temporarily unsets:
  * the `tabs.warnOnClose` built-in preference, which otherwise disrupts the handeling of the close event
  * `mail.biff.show_tray_icon` for mail applications

KNOWN BUGS
----------

* windows aren't restored with the same z-order, but there is [no means to correct that under Linux](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=156333 "GetZOrderDOMWindowEnumerator is broken on Linux")

* notifications for excluded mail account servers are not
  disabled. Newmailalerts are
  [hard-coded](http://mxr.mozilla.org/comm-central/find?string=content/newmailalert)
  and we can't easily disable them on a per-server basis (only globally, see
  `mail.biff.show_alert`). The proper way would probably be to disable default
  notifications globally, and handle notifications ourselves. This is out of
  the scope of this addon, but you may want to give a try to the
  [MailAlert extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/mailbox-alert/)

* child windows (compose message, preferences, ...)  are not handled by
  Icetray. For ex., they are not hidden along with there top-level window.

* because of `getNumNewMessages()`'s
  [strange behaviour](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=727460),
  it's impossible to display an accurate count of *new messages*. The best we
  can do is display a biff icon.

* POP users should set
  [http://kb.mozillazine.org/Thunderbird_:_FAQs_:_Automatically_Download_Messages](Automatically
  download new messages) to see new message. See
  [this discussion](https://github.com/foudfou/FireTray/issues/20).

* some features [do not work well under Unity/Compiz](https://github.com/foudfou/FireTray/issues/22).
